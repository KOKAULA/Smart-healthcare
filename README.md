Urban population seems to be completely health secure where as a vast number of population in India does not have access to these facilities.
We aim towards using internet to achieve smart healthcare in India as the key to bridge the gap between the needy and the hospitals
We would like to make a software interface which analogous to the companies like swiggy allows you to connect to hospitals and get appointment and manage all your scans,deatails.
It consists of 3 parts:
1)Using voice detection system to allow needy to communicate their problem ,thus avoiding the language barrier(for non private organizations and government hospital linking)
2)A interface for user by which he could choose any hospital in his locality and book a appointment with a doctor and also manage all his scan reports and medicinal details in one single complete package
3)This app also tracks basic fitness parameters like weigth,height and other basic parameters and suggests diet,workout plan to improve both mental and physical health
